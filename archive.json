I don't see why this process wouldn't scale out to multiple organizations if the service were available, but we would need to have some discussion about integrating that.

The practice here has evolved a little and so the text should be expanded to reflect that.\r\n\r\nThe current view is that drafts in early stages can operate with a fair amount of independence in the sense that technical decisions can be made without consulting the list.  That keeps things running smoothly, because you don't want the overhead of list involvement for every tiny technical change.\r\n\r\nAs the draft already says issues that become contentious need to go to the list.  But the draft says SHOULD rather than MUST, which needs to be corrected.\r\n\r\nAs documents become more mature, it makes sense to change the model so that the list is involved in more of the decision-making.  For example, QUIC has taken the line that ALL technical changes need to go to the list, which is fairly hard-line.  The goals there were two-fold: reduce the rate of change, and to ensure that the list is involved in all decisions.  The first has been very effective.  It's hard to say whether a hard cutoff like this has been effective, but the general principle is sound.",

Area Directors MAY also designate a delegate that becomes an owner and working group chairs MAY also be owners.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, GitHub now only gives the choice between Owners being able to create repos, and all members being able to create repos (see [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/restricting-repository-creation-in-your-organization)). I don't think the latter is workable (we've already had instances when some WG members strongly wanted to create a WG repo for their personal drafts), so this means that the Chairs MUST be owners, unless they're comfortable with allowing anyone in the org to create a repo.\r\n\r\nThis choice probably needs to be explained explicitly, with description of the options and the affected settings.\r\n\r\n> A team with administrator access SHOULD be created for the Working Group Chairs and any Working Group Secretary. Administrator access is preferable, since this does not also include the ability to push to all repositories and ownership does not grant any other significant privileges.\r\n\r\nThere is no longer any such thing as an \"admin team\" on GitHub; that was [phased out](https://help.github.com/en/articles/migrating-your-previous-admin-teams-to-the-improved-organization-permissions). Instead, you'd need to create a separate 'Chairs' team and then assign it admin permissions on each repo.\r\n\r\nIn practice, Chairs need the ability to push to all repositories, to do things like update READMEs, etc. So I think being owners is appropriate (and it avoids a lot of busy work for the AD in terms of setting things up).\r\n",

Disabling features can be a useful way to slim down the options presented to users (which can help new users), but it can also be fairly hostile to new contributors.  For instance, if the working group disables issues because they aren't using them, it sounds reasonable, but new contributors might then be dissuaded from opening a genuine issue.  Working groups might be better served by informally letting contributors know how to best provide their input.",

It cannot be assumed that ADs, chairs, authors or contributors have an existing login to GitHub or have ever used it. For some WGs, it may make sense to start with an ultra-light approach to using GitHub. This would allow draft authors to make use of basic GitHub functionality and allow WG chairs to get some initial experience (if this is the level they are at in their GitHub journey). Independent of experience or knowledge, this approach may also be useful for a WG happy with its current way of doing work, that would like to make use of GitHub as a very simple tool to enhance existing methods of collaboration.\r\n\r\nGitHub can be used in an \"ultra-light\" manner by setting it up primarily for use by draft authors. They can use issues and comments to discuss the draft among themselves, and they can use it to provide WG members with a preview \"Editor's Copy\" to confirm on-list comments have been adequately resolved (prior to submitting to Datatracker).\r\n\r\nAll WG discussion happens on the email list.\r\n\r\nUsing GitHub in this manner is simplest if each draft has its own repository.\r\n\r\nThe repository can be set up with the authors as a team with Write access. They can decide among themselves how they want to work. All other GitHub members have Read access. The WG is informed of the existence of the repository, but told that all issues are to be discussed on the list. \r\n\r\nThe authors can choose to make full use of the available tools for automating processes, or manually perform Datatracker submissions and GitHub pages. If the draft is written using XML, it is even possible to avoid installing any tools. The on-line version of xml2rfc can be used to check the draft, and the GitHub UI can be used to upload draft versions. For users of Microsoft Windows, it is also possible to use [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) to interact with GitHub for for all aspects of ultra-light interaction.",

I think the \"ultra-light\" description assumes no one will be opening issues aside from document editors, in which case the bit about having to be vigilant to return issue discussion to the list doesn't really apply because the editors are just using the issue tracker for their own purposes. One further step in the progression is when WG participants start opening issues themselves, at which point someone needs to be responsible for directing discussion to the venue the WG has chosen (issues vs. mailing list).

This is made moot by the other changes that Martin made to the draft, but to be clear, I don't think that's a good line of argumentation.\r\n\r\nThe WG was charted to an explicit scope - that WGs had to opt into the practices it documented. If it _were_ producing a document that exceeded that scope (which is arguably did before the recent change referenced above), saying that the WG \"has consensus\" to violate its charter is meaningless, and letting that stand is damaging.\r\n\r\nThat's because charters allow people to decide whether or not they're going to follow a WG. If a WG can violate its charter and justify that with \"but we had consensus to do so\", charters are meaningless, and the check that requiring IETF consensus places upon WGs is seriously diminished.",
